  <h1>Rushmore Review</h1>
</div>



<div class="post">
  <p>Rushmore was a great coming of age movie filled with unconventional actors, problems, and solutions.</p>

<p>Rushmore is a story of &ldquo;Love, Expulsion, Revolution&rdquo;. It features Jason Schwartzmann as Max Fischer, Bill Murray as Herman Blume, and Olivia Williams as Rosemary Cross. Rushmore in a nutshell it about how far Max and Herman will go in order to secure the affection of Mrs.Cross. In the pursuit of Mrs.Cross, the pair run into ideas of arrogance, maturity, and belonging.</p>

<p>There are going to be a few spoilers. Apologies in advance.</p>

<p>Part 1: Fischer &amp; friends

<p>A whole essay could probably be written on the eccentricities that Max Fischer represents and what those are symbolic of. One key part is his initial commitment to Rushmore and all the clubs and teams he takes part in. It&rsquo;s seemingly a way for him to squeeze the most out of the opportunity that he was given through his scholarship, though quite ironically at the full expense of his schoolwork (his scholarship was based on the play he wrote however so not too surprising). Max is an altogether brilliant caricature, the geek that isn&rsquo;t astonishingly unpopular. Someone who makes acting, fencing, beekeeping, and French cool. He&rsquo;s one of the first cinematic hipsters. To that effect, I would like to delve into the effect his character has on the movie itself. It&rsquo;s thoroughly a film that oscillates between taking itself seriously and then going all out to great effect. We see Max first as an overachieving student then a quick conversion to a budding industrialist aquarium builder. Max&rsquo;s exploits contribute to a brilliantly absurd yet fun film. His determination as well as his jealousy are unmatched and it&rsquo;s honestly inspiring to imagine someone who can make things happen like him. Even his ability to almost murder Herman Blume is commendable. I&rsquo;ll keep the last bit of the review short but Max&rsquo;s relationship with Mrs.Cross is very interesting and complex. She&rsquo;s simultaneously a mother figure to him as well as an object of affection. She acts as the pacemaker of the movie, with her actions driving the movement of the plot and in turn the development of both Herman and Max. It&rsquo;s a curious dynamic to describe and even moreso to watch. (Margaret is also a really interesting foil to Mrs.Cross but there isn&rsquo;t enough time to discuss her. Sorry Le-Chahn!)</p>

<p>Part 2: The curious case of Herman Blume

I actually can also spend another essay talking about Herman Blume and how Bill Murray is the perfect character to portray him. I&rsquo;ll cover Herman, but take a look at the following video to learn about Murray&rsquo;s charm, which I think is really present in this movie:</p>

<p>Onto Herman however. It&rsquo;s definitely true that Herman is to some extent as mature as Max - which is both a testament to Max&rsquo;s maturity and Herman&rsquo;s radical immaturity. Herman is almost a foil for Max in the beginning of the movie, at least when it came to personal matters. Herman seemed to have experienced enough in his life to connect with Mrs.Cross and seemingly plays the mature role. He then proceeds to enter a turf war with a 15 year old teenager and eventually gets divorced while pursuing Mrs.Cross before she dumps him. It&rsquo;s a mess.
What is brilliant is the idea that Herman is somehow saved by Max, acting as yet another conduit for his own growth as a person. He&rsquo;s the one who leads Herman, to the tune of &ldquo;Oh Yoko&rdquo; and then through the war-torn lands of a 2-part &ldquo;Apocalypse Now&rdquo;-esque play . The reversal isn&rsquo;t expected and neither are the tears shed by Bill Murray at the end of the performance. Even though less focus is placed on Herman, his similarities to Max give the audience a definite connection to the character and his struggles, altered slightly by his age and position.</p>

<p>Part 3: Coming together

<p>One could argue that Max and Herman were both boys who became men at the end of the film. Their relationship was sparked by a mutual interest in each other, Herman in Max&rsquo;s ambition and Max in Herman&rsquo;s own determination. What&rsquo;s curious is that in the end, it seems that Max ignited Herman&rsquo;s ambition again while Max in turn gained a bit of determination from Blume himself. The two are, to quote Mrs.Cross, &ldquo;perfect for each other&rdquo;. The dynamic between the two characters is arguably the driving force in the movie (Technically the force behind the Mrs.Cross affair). The most interesting contrast between these two is the bottom of their war for Mrs.Cross and the final reconciliation between the two. The initial bickering over her which led to the pair&rsquo;s eventual falling out was a dangerous dance. What I would argue is more important would be the unification of the pair again after reconciling the presence that Mrs.Cross represented in their lives. Harman and Max never were as vibrant apart as they were together once they had left their mark on the other&rsquo;s life. I covered a bit of the final event in the above section but it is definitely important to note the symbolism present in the film&rsquo;s ending. Max and Mrs.Cross are seen waltzing in to a huge assortment of happy revelers at the after party. It&rsquo;s the dance that Max never kenw he wanted at the beginning of the movie, but the one he definitely deserves at the end. How the two settled their confused emotions about each other really marked growth for both of them, while Herman in the background never seemed happier.</p>

<p>Rushmore was a great movie. I didn&rsquo;t even get started on how Wes Anderson&rsquo;s style is so pervasive in the film, but that is something the audience will surely notice for themselves. I highly encourage you to watch this film. I certainly didn&rsquo;t do justice to all the characters and settings that formed the foundation for this hipster love triangle to blossom and change our characters.</p>

<p>Currently still thinking about next week&rsquo;s topic, the results of which will be revealed on the day of. Hope to see you back again, thanks for reading!s</p>
