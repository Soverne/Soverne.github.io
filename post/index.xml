      <title>Rushmore Review</title>
      <link>http://soverne.github.io/post/rushmore/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rushmore was a great coming of age movie filled with unconventional actors, problems, and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rushmore is a story of &amp;ldquo;Love, Expulsion, Revolution&amp;rdquo;. It features Jason Schwartzmann as Max Fischer, Bill Murray as Herman Blume, and Olivia Williams as Rosemary Cross. Rushmore in a nutshell it about how far Max and Herman will go in order to secure the affection of Mrs.Cross. In the pursuit of Mrs.Cross, the pair run into ideas of arrogance, maturity, and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are going to be a few spoilers. Apologies in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1: Fischer &amp;amp; friends

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://soverne.github.io/media/rushmore/rush1.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Max Fischer at his finest&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole essay could probably be written on the eccentricities that Max Fischer represents and what those are symbolic of. One key part is his initial commitment to Rushmore and all the clubs and teams he takes part in. It&amp;rsquo;s seemingly a way for him to squeeze the most out of the opportunity that he was given through his scholarship, though quite ironically at the full expense of his schoolwork (his scholarship was based on the play he wrote however so not too surprising). Max is an altogether brilliant caricature, the geek that isn&amp;rsquo;t astonishingly unpopular. Someone who makes acting, fencing, beekeeping, and French cool. He&amp;rsquo;s one of the first cinematic hipsters. To that effect, I would like to delve into the effect his character has on the movie itself. It&amp;rsquo;s thoroughly a film that oscillates between taking itself seriously and then going all out to great effect. We see Max first as an overachieving student then a quick conversion to a budding industrialist aquarium builder. Max&amp;rsquo;s exploits contribute to a brilliantly absurd yet fun film. His determination as well as his jealousy are unmatched and it&amp;rsquo;s honestly inspiring to imagine someone who can make things happen like him. Even his ability to almost murder Herman Blume is commendable. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep the last bit of the review short but Max&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Mrs.Cross is very interesting and complex. She&amp;rsquo;s simultaneously a mother figure to him as well as an object of affection. She acts as the pacemaker of the movie, with her actions driving the movement of the plot and in turn the development of both Herman and Max. It&amp;rsquo;s a curious dynamic to describe and even moreso to watch. (Margaret is also a really interesting foil to Mrs.Cross but there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough time to discuss her. Sorry Le-Chahn!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2: The curious case of Herman Blume

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://soverne.github.io/media/rushmore/rush2.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;He&amp;#39;s drowning in sorrows, alcohol, cigarettes, and pool water&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        He&amp;#39;s drowning in sorrows, alcohol, cigarettes, and pool water
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

I actually can also spend another essay talking about Herman Blume and how Bill Murray is the perfect character to portray him. I&amp;rsquo;ll cover Herman, but take a look at the following video to learn about Murray&amp;rsquo;s charm, which I think is really present in this movie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&#34;youtube-player&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;385&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3_j0BlbUy8&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Onto Herman however. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely true that Herman is to some extent as mature as Max - which is both a testament to Max&amp;rsquo;s maturity and Herman&amp;rsquo;s radical immaturity. Herman is almost a foil for Max in the beginning of the movie, at least when it came to personal matters. Herman seemed to have experienced enough in his life to connect with Mrs.Cross and seemingly plays the mature role. He then proceeds to enter a turf war with a 15 year old teenager and eventually gets divorced while pursuing Mrs.Cross before she dumps him. It&amp;rsquo;s a mess.
What is brilliant is the idea that Herman is somehow saved by Max, acting as yet another conduit for his own growth as a person. He&amp;rsquo;s the one who leads Herman, to the tune of &amp;ldquo;Oh Yoko&amp;rdquo; and then through the war-torn lands of a 2-part &amp;ldquo;Apocalypse Now&amp;rdquo;-esque play . The reversal isn&amp;rsquo;t expected and neither are the tears shed by Bill Murray at the end of the performance. Even though less focus is placed on Herman, his similarities to Max give the audience a definite connection to the character and his struggles, altered slightly by his age and position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 3: Coming together

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://soverne.github.io/media/rushmore/rush3.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;True.&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        True.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could argue that Max and Herman were both boys who became men at the end of the film. Their relationship was sparked by a mutual interest in each other, Herman in Max&amp;rsquo;s ambition and Max in Herman&amp;rsquo;s own determination. What&amp;rsquo;s curious is that in the end, it seems that Max ignited Herman&amp;rsquo;s ambition again while Max in turn gained a bit of determination from Blume himself. The two are, to quote Mrs.Cross, &amp;ldquo;perfect for each other&amp;rdquo;. The dynamic between the two characters is arguably the driving force in the movie (Technically the force behind the Mrs.Cross affair). The most interesting contrast between these two is the bottom of their war for Mrs.Cross and the final reconciliation between the two. The initial bickering over her which led to the pair&amp;rsquo;s eventual falling out was a dangerous dance. What I would argue is more important would be the unification of the pair again after reconciling the presence that Mrs.Cross represented in their lives. Harman and Max never were as vibrant apart as they were together once they had left their mark on the other&amp;rsquo;s life. I covered a bit of the final event in the above section but it is definitely important to note the symbolism present in the film&amp;rsquo;s ending. Max and Mrs.Cross are seen waltzing in to a huge assortment of happy revelers at the after party. It&amp;rsquo;s the dance that Max never kenw he wanted at the beginning of the movie, but the one he definitely deserves at the end. How the two settled their confused emotions about each other really marked growth for both of them, while Herman in the background never seemed happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rushmore was a great movie. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get started on how Wes Anderson&amp;rsquo;s style is so pervasive in the film, but that is something the audience will surely notice for themselves. I highly encourage you to watch this film. I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t do justice to all the characters and settings that formed the foundation for this hipster love triangle to blossom and change our characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently still thinking about next week&amp;rsquo;s topic, the results of which will be revealed on the day of. Hope to see you back again, thanks for reading!s&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A quick update to the blog format</title>
      <link>http://soverne.github.io/post/2A-update/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick update for all y&amp;rsquo;all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to try to post regularly but I have come to realize the difficulty of writing high quality content twice a week. I&amp;rsquo;m going to attempt to keep this medium going by continuing to post as often I can. The current plan is to post once a week, looking towards Friday - which is hopefully when the Rushmore review will finally come out. (It&amp;rsquo;ll be good I promise)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing forward, I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to do regular posts on Friday about serious topics with some other posts mixed in when possible. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely keep mixing in as much technology analysis as possible because that is what I am passionate about. I might also put in a plug for any cool side projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on, just to show off a little ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, apologies for being so slow again. The next post will be on time and I&amp;rsquo;ll keep trying to adapt to this routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to quote Elon Musk on this one, &amp;ldquo;No, I don’t ever give up. I’d have to be dead or completely incapacitated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Augmented and Virtual Reality, the turtle and the hare</title>
      <link>http://soverne.github.io/post/ar-vr/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s conceivable that VR is going to change the world soon. I&amp;rsquo;d like to argue that AR is already doing so and will be the predominant force for at least the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brief disclaimer: I do not claim to be able to predict the future. Please don&amp;rsquo;t make any large decisions as a result of this blog post. This is my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-prediction&#34;&gt;A prediction&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://soverne.github.io/media/arvr.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They say a picture&amp;rsquo;s worth a thousand words, the one above might be a few less than that. In essence, I think that the number of &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo;, people who have access to AR and VR technologies, will use AR more in the next few years than they will VR. VR might even get displaced a bit as AR is becoming mainstream. I argue that this is because of three &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; advantages of AR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower tech barrier to entry - You can experience AR right now if you have access to a smartphone or a webcam of some sort. Mac OSX has (as far as I can remember) shipped with Photobooth that allows users to add backgrounds to their photos. Pokemon GO on the other hand can bring Pokemon to life wherever the camera is facing. From a hardware perspective, some sort of optics are all that are required to bring create an AR experience because AR is fundamentally about adding on to reality. VR is more about simulating or creating an alternate reality. To get that done, more powerful processors and batteries are needed along with specialized screens and an isolation apparatus. Sound has to be considered and maybe even taste, touch, and smell if one wants to fully substitute a current reality with a great virtual one. Specialized controllers are also a cost for VR, while the ubiquity of AR has allowed for touch to be a simple input for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower bounds for value - When it comes to AR, it can be argued that it is a culmination of a tool-oriented mindset that humans have always had. Augmented reality can be leveraged to build &lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt; for people. I know of augmented reality applications that can simulate how a piece of furniture would look in your home. That&amp;rsquo;s cool stuff. VR on the other hand has stagnated as mainly venues for consuming content, mainly gaming and or other curated experiences. This current state of affairs places AR as something to use to produce and VR as something to use to consume. This will definitely change as VR inputs get more intuitive and smart people start pushing the limits of the tech. For now, AR is ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portability - Once VR becomes something that isn&amp;rsquo;t reserved only for use at home or expositions, it will completely change the way people think of reality. Until then, AR will be the dominant next generation platform. VR cafe&amp;rsquo;s, like internet cafe&amp;rsquo;s, might be the next big thing for people to consume content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;to-conclude&#34;&gt;To conclude&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, I believe the pre-requisite technology for VR to become a mass-produced product is not available at the moment. Until then, people who work on VR will hopefully
Given the rate of technological advancement, my current prediction is that VR adoption will grow faster than AR by 2021. Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll reach a point where a VR headset in each home becomes the norm and not the exception (VR headset is inclusive of various phone based VR headsets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully more developers think of ways to add value to the VR experience. It has to be a better way of experiencing something than real life. Until then, AR will reign supreme by being able to add on to the world around us. Just for the record, I&amp;rsquo;m not biased against either tech. I for one welcome the newest cutting edge technology into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! My next post will be a film review of Rushmore by Wes Anderson and maybe Boyhood by Richard Linklater (depending on how much off-time I have this weekend).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One liners x7</title>
      <link>http://soverne.github.io/post/one-liners/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re as silly as they are short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t easy to be original and even harder to be actually funny. I&amp;rsquo;ll get straight to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I substituted the thyme with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I rarely find myself in front of The Rock and A Hard Rock Cafe, but when I do it&amp;rsquo;s when I&amp;rsquo;m writing a post about oneliners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A baby shower at a divorce hearing is no fun for both parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A casino goer was punched while at the blackjack table. This was the third run and pun incident this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s humble side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always make an effort not to mention Japan while I shop for German Kitchenware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manners are as old as the trees, always start your request with &amp;ldquo;Wood you please&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the writing of this post, I realized the value of delivery to a joke. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t laugh while reading it, try telling it to a friend (and share the blog). Hopefully they don&amp;rsquo;t get injured laughing out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about why I think VR is the future but AR is the present. Next Monday will a bring a review of a few movies I recently watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing up above gave you a laugh, hopefully this will:

      <title>How I missed the moon ... and the schedule</title>
      <link>http://soverne.github.io/post/first-friday/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s less than a week since I&amp;rsquo;ve set up the blog and I already missed the first deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;to-be-honest&#34;&gt;To be honest&amp;hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://soverne.github.io/media/feels.png&#34; alt=&#34;it feels bad man.&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        it feels bad man.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This does segue into a fun topic to explore, the idea of expectations. A generally good way to live life is to &lt;strong&gt;under-promise and over-deliver&lt;/strong&gt;. Assuming a bit of common sense about not bottoming out on expectations, you will always surprise yourself and other people (Great success!). I have generally done the opposite, setting unrealistic expectations and ending with an average to above-average performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is currently fairly average by my performance standards: Use Hugo, write, push to github &lt;strong&gt;on time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for not getting this post out on time. I hope Monday&amp;rsquo;s post will arrive on time but I&amp;rsquo;m moving into residence that day so anything goes :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-lesser-known-side-effect-of-not-meeting-expectations&#34;&gt;A lesser known side effect of not meeting expectations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; is that one gets a lot of practice with completing &amp;ldquo;post-mortems&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ll share the one I wrote up in response to being late for the first serious blog post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why it happened&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m lazy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers are hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.ca/search?q=nuka+world&#34; target=&#34;blank&#34;&gt; Nuka World&lt;/a&gt; just released for Fallout 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I can remedy the situation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post as soon as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apologize profusely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add extra markdown flair to distract from late-ness (Say hello to pictures and a table of contents!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I&amp;rsquo;ll prevent it from happening again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a quick outline of the next post immediately after writing current post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a habit of practicing periodic concentration to ward off procrastination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Edit the blog timestamp&lt;/del&gt; Post something on time and edit later if time permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;to-conclude&#34;&gt;To conclude&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough one-liners to last you a week are (probably) coming out on Monday - I&amp;rsquo;ve already written up the outline. That&amp;rsquo;s all folks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A legendary blog begins with a single post&amp;rdquo; - 21st Century Confucius&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the blog. I promise it won&amp;rsquo;t always be this cheesy.
I&amp;rsquo;m Tony, currently finishing my first co-op term and moving into 2A Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m starting a blog so I can write a bit more outside of Facebook messages and class notes. I would also like to share some knowledge about topics that don&amp;rsquo;t get brought up in normal conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on adding a comment section to my posts but if you have any feedback feel free to send me an email at htonydeng+blog@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current plan is two write two blog posts a week. One serious post and one that isn&amp;rsquo;t. The tentative schedule is a funny post on Monday and a serious post on Friday. I&amp;rsquo;m currently trying to work on my humor so I&amp;rsquo;m going to be posting a compilation of 7 fun one-liner jokes that I think of during the week. More fun things to come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, see you all this Friday!&lt;/p&gt;
